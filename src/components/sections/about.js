            Hi, I am Avinash Kumar Singh, currently I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in Department of Computing Science, 
            Umea University Sweden . We do work on training the robots in such a way that, if they will have any conflict with 
            regard to performing any activity, they raise their concern and ask for the external help to resolve that conflict. 
            We are using Pepper robot as our testbed to test our algorithms. Prior to join this Post-Doctoral Program, 
            I was associated with HCL Technologies as an Deputy Manager. There, I headed the Machine Learning team to design 
            various solutions, such as an intelligent KYC system, Information Mining, Signature Verification, Automatic Cheque Clarence. 
            I had a chance to work with eClerx Services located at Navi Mumbai as a Technology Specialist for Machine Learning. 
            I stayed there for almost one and half year and conducted various projects related to Email Classification, 
            Anaphora Resolution, Document Colouring.
            </p>

            I am a Ph.D. in Human Robot Interaction from Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, 
            Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. During my Ph.D., we aimed to build a reliable and intelligent 
            framework for robots, so that they could interact with human as we do in our daily life. We have developed a facial 
            symmetry and component-based face recognition system to mitigate the variable illumination and expression scenarios. 
            Since we have used only a part of the face, the approach is computationally faster. A research is also conducted to help 
            police in criminal identification. We had NAO humanoid robot which was trained to establish the verbal communication with 
            human in the natural language (English). Nao communicates with the eyewitness and tries to collect the visual as well 
            physiological description about the criminal. This visual description is then processed to find the match with the 
            existing database, if the match is found, the information about the criminal is retrieved otherwise Nao creates the 
            sketch of the same.
