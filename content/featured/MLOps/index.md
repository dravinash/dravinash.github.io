We setup end to end flow for object detection that includes data loading, data visualization, augmentation, training, validation and model deployement on the edge device as well as on the server. We gave support for the different augmentation techniques to increase the sample count as well as flexibility to choose the model type between, Yolo, Faster-RCNN and MobileNet. At the end user can select model and the user id to push the model to be downloaded into the edge device.
