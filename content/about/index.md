Hi, I am Avinash, thank you for visiting my page. I love solving real life problems with the help of Artificial Inteligence. I did my Ph.D in Human-Robot Interaction from [Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad](https://www.iiita.ac.in/). During my Ph.D., we aimed to build a reliable and intelligent framework for robots, so that they could interact with human as we do in our daily life. If you are interested, please see my contributions at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=eH9aB9kAAAAJ&hl=en) and my [Youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRdJsCCYkkSp9qhqW4Wbh2Q). 

I got the opportunity to work on the extension of my Ph.D work in two subsequent post doctorals. I was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in Department of Computing Science, [Umea University Sweden](https://www.umu.se/en/). There, I worked on training the Pepper Humanoid Robots to assist senior citizens. The robot was programmed to understand human commands (in english) and corelate the language to visual perception. This work was conducted under the research grant given by [Kempe Fundation](https://www.kempe.com/).

I was associated with LIRMM lab [Montpellier University France](https://www.lirmm.fr/lirmm-en/) as a post-doctoral researcher. This was my second postdoctoral, there we trained a deep neural network model to understand human activities in industrial setup for better Human robot collaboration. I was the part of [H2020 project SOPHIA](https://project-sophia.eu/) and incharge of work package 5.  

I have 10+ years experience working with artificial intelligence and applying this as a tool to solve different problems. I have worked with different organization ([eClerx](https://eclerx.com/), [HCL](https://www.hcltech.com/), [In-D](https://in-d.ai/)) and helped them to designe, develope and execute AI based solutions.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
