I joined the HCL machine learning division (Noida) when this was a 3 members team. In the span of one year, we conducted 4 successful POCs and grew the team to a 16 members team. 
- As a deputy manager my responsibilities were to handle the client interaction, project scoping, find the place where machine learning solutions can be pitched (to integrated with existing workflows) within and outside the organization.
- Helped my team to setup the machine learning GPU infrastructure, sketching project roadmaps, resource allocation and tracking. Further motivating team to follow the software engineering best practices such as maintaining git, hygiene of code (following the coding standards), etc.
