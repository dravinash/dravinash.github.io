During the postdoc, I worked on humanoid robots. We trained them to assist humans in the household scenarios.

- We designed a dialogue based human robot interaction system that allows humans, to talk to the robot.

- A dialogue generation system is added to translate robot's action into the natural language so that they would be understandable.
