During the postdoc, I worked on humanoid robots. We trained them to assist senior citizen in the household scenarios.

- During this postdoc, I closely worked with Professor [Kai-Florian Richter](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/kai-florian-richter/) and Professor [Thomas Hellström](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/thomas-hellstrom/). I was a part of intelligent robotics lab, during this postdoc, we designed a dialogue based human robot interaction system that allows humans, to talk to the robot. This work was published in a ‘A’ rated conference [ECAI-2020](https://ecai2020.eu/papers/1441_paper.pdf).
- We developed and implemented a robot collaboration framework that enables robots to have dialogues by translating their actions into the natural language. This work was published in [Journal of behavioural robotics](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/pjbr-2021-0001/html) and also featured in Softbank robotics under the [best 20 projects in 2020](https://youtu.be/QNfaUycVAXo?t=78).
