I was associated with the robotics lab (LIRMM, France) and worked on the EU Project [SOPHIA](https://project-sophia.eu/). I was incharge of Work package 5, where I worked on human robot collaboration and my responsibilities were.

- Activity Recognition: Given the RGB-D and sensor data (kinematic and kinetic) we need to recognize the activity such as opening the door, handovering the object, grasping etc.

- Physical Interaction: Help human in physical assistance, e.g holding and passing the object in industrial environment by understanding the human gesture, facial expression etc.
