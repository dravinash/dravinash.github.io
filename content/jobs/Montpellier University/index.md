I was associated with the robotics lab (LIRMM) and worked on the EU Project [SOPHIA](https://project-sophia.eu/). As the in-charge of Work package 5, I helped my team to coordinate between different project partners [Italian Institute of Technology, Italy](https://www.iit.it/), [INAIL, Italy](https://www.inail.it/cs/internet/home.html), and [LIRMM, France](https://www.lirmm.fr/lirmm-en/) for data acquisition, human-robot interaction and to derive a deep learning model for action recognition.
- Designed and developed a sensor agnostic, Bidirectional LSTM based deep neural network for action recognition. The model is tested in the presence of [Xsens suit](https://www.xsens.com/motion-capture) (used for motion capture) and Intel RealSense and Microsoft Kinect RGB-D data (3D skeleton). The research is published in [21st International Conference on Humanoid Robots](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10000226).
- The model is integrated with KUKA robot to help human in physical assistance, e.g. carrying object, release object, place object etc. in industrial environment by understanding the human actions.
