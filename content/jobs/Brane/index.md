- Data Flow for the deep learning systems: We have setup an end to end process of data collection,validation and labeling for computer vision as well as natural language processing problems.

- We have developed an a no-code platform that helps user to load the training population, configure the hyper parameters and then allow training and deploy the model without writing a single line of code.

- We have created a language model to convert English query to python code that helps user to generate the python code for a given problem. Further, we integrated it into the VS code editor to speed the python development time.
