description: Hi, I am Avinash Kumar Singh, currently I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in Department of Mathematics and Information Technology, Umea University Sweden. We do work on training the robots in such a way that, if they will have any conflict with regard to performing any activity, they raise their concern and ask for the external help to resolve that conflict.  We are using Pepper robot as our testbed to test our algorithms. Prior to join this Post-Doctoral Program, I was associated with HCL Innovation Lab as an Deputy Manager. There, I headed the Machine Learning team to design various solutions, such as an intelligent KYC system, Information Mining, Signature Verification, Automatic Cheque Clarence. I had a chance to work with eClerx Services located at Navi Mumbai as a Technology Specialist for Machine Learning. I stayed there for almost one and half year and conducted various projects related to Email Classification, Anaphora Resolution, Document Colouring. I am a Ph.D. in Human Robot Interaction from Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. During my Ph.D., we aimed to build a reliable and intelligent framework for robots, so that they could interact with human as we do in our daily life. We have developed a facial symmetry and component-based face recognition system to mitigate the variable illumination and expression scenarios. Since we have used only a part of the face, the approach is computationally faster. A research is also conducted to help police in criminal identification. We had NAO humanoid robot which was trained to establish the verbal communication with human in the natural language (English). Nao communicates with the eyewitness and tries to collect the visual as well physiological description about the criminal. This visual description is then processed to find the match with the existing database, if the match is found, the information about the criminal is retrieved otherwise Nao creates the sketch of the same.
My research focus on Human Robot Interaction, Computer Vision and Deep Learning. If you are interested about such projects, you should visit the research page.
