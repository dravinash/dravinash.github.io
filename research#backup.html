<meta name="description" content="Hi, I am Avinash Kumar Singh, currently I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in Department of Mathematics and Information Technology, Umea University Sweden. We do work on training the robots in such a way that, if they will have any conflict with regard to performing any activity, they raise their concern and ask for the external help to resolve that conflict.  We are using Pepper robot as our testbed to test our algorithms. Prior to join this Post-Doctoral Program, I was associated with HCL Innovation Lab as an Deputy Manager. There, I headed the Machine Learning team to design various solutions, such as an intelligent KYC system, Information Mining, Signature Verification, Automatic Cheque Clarence. I had a chance to work with eClerx Services located at Navi Mumbai as a Technology Specialist for Machine Learning. I stayed there for almost one and half year and conducted various projects related to Email Classification, Anaphora Resolution, Document Colouring. 
I am a Ph.D. in Human Robot Interaction from Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. During my Ph.D., we aimed to build a reliable and intelligent framework for robots, so that they could interact with human as we do in our daily life. We have developed a facial symmetry and component-based face recognition system to mitigate the variable illumination and expression scenarios. Since we have used only a part of the face, the approach is computationally faster. A research is also conducted to help police in criminal identification. We had NAO humanoid robot which was trained to establish the verbal communication with human in the natural language (English). Nao communicates with the eyewitness and tries to collect the visual as well physiological description about the criminal. This visual description is then processed to find the match with the existing database, if the match is found, the information about the criminal is retrieved otherwise Nao creates the sketch of the same. 
My research focus on Human Robot Interaction, Computer Vision and Deep Learning. If you are interested about such projects, you should visit the research page.

                                        The system is designed to extract particular values from the email. There are three parameters such as field type, background, context are needs to be configured in order to extract the particular field values. In order to define the field type, we have used Stanford and NLTK named entity recognition. Field types helps us to localize the organization, person name, location etc. in the sentence. Context is used to find the relevant value, if a field have multiple instance of the same field type. For example there are two organization in the same sentence, context guides us to pick up the right one. Background is a check, if a field can have only certain allowed values, it can be used to check whatever the value retrieved by the system is correct or not.

                                        Relative page extractor used to extract the relevant pages from the document. The problem is defined such as: we have a magazine who have different sections such as politics, bollywood, cricket and finance. We have to extract only those pages where cricket news lies. A training module is created which requires the training samples (the document) and the page number where the particular section lies. The system utilizes the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to identify particular features of the page. Later these features are utilized to find the match with the other pages of the document. Based on the matching an score is calculated which defines the colour score of that page. We have defined a criterion function to estimate the relative pages.

                                        The designed system checks for the negative news about the given entity(person/organization) in the given document. In a document, there are only few sentences which belongs to the given entity. Hence, here the challenge is to find the relevant sentences for the given entity. We have created a Anaphora Resolution framework to construct the relative sentence set and later the sentiment analysis if performed to find out the sentiment about the entity. We have utilized the named entity recognition and POS taggers to establish the linking between the relative sentences while TextBlob library is used to estimate the sentiment.

										Face is the most frequently used biometric trait after fingerprint.
										Its applicability made it popular in different areas such as Human
										Robot Interaction (HRI), Security Authentication, and
										Surveillance to name a few. Face recognition concept is based on
										two major blocks, training and testing. Usually training is done
										offline while testing is performed in real time scenario. As the size
										of the database increases, the recognition rate (time taken by
										system to recognize) increases. The rate of recognition is directly
										proportional to the size of the database and the dimension of the
										images. Human faces have the vertical symmetry; hence we
										utilized this feature and proposed a half way face recognition
										approach. Experimental verification on both the full faces and the
										half faces shows that half faces are also sufficient for recognizing
										the person. For verifying the efficiency of the approach, we have
										applied PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on both, the full
										faces and half faces, and have found that in both the cases,
										accuracy is almost same. But the recognition rate of half faces is
										just the half of the full faces.</p>

													Two redundant degrees of freedom elbow yaw (RElbowYaw) and wrist yaw (RWristYaw) 
													of the right hand have been sacrificed because of their less contribution in drawing. 
													The Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters of the system has been defined in order to measure 
													the working envelop of the right hand as well as to achieve the inverse kinematic solution. 
													A linear transformation has been used to transform the image points with respect to real world 
													coordinate system and novel 4 point calibration technique has been proposed to calibrate the real 
													world coordinate system with respect to NAO end effector.</p>

                                        The strength of the NAO humanoid robot is discussed with several challenges in the arena of human
                                        portrait and sketch drawing. These challenges include extracting feature points from the input image,
                                        defining these points with respect to end effector, finding the inverse kinematics solution and designing
                                        a visual feedback system. This paper mainly addresses the fundamental issue of defining a relationship
                                        between the points of the image plane and NAO end effector position. This relationship enables NAO to
                                        perceive points of image plane with respect to its body coordinate system. Three different techniques
                                        based on the principles of fundamental matrix, pseudo inverse and Artificial Neural Network based
                                        regression analysis are applied to handle the calibration difficulties on NAO robot. A comprehensive study
                                        on sample points collected fromNAOend effector position and corresponding image points has been made
                                        to understand the effectiveness of each technique. The degree of performance ability of each technique
                                        has been measured using time complexity, and mean square error metrics.</p>

                                                    The visual perception of eyewitness plays a vital role in criminal identification
													scenario. It helps law enforcement authorities in searching particular criminal
													from their previous record. It has been reported that searching a criminal
													record manually requires too much time to get the accurate result. We have
													proposed a query-based approach which minimises the computational
													cost along with the reduction of search space. A symbolic database has
													been created to perform a stringent analysis on 150 public (Bollywood
													celebrities and Indian cricketers) and 90 local faces (our data-set). An expert
													knowledge has been captured to encapsulate every criminal’s anatomical
													and facial attributes in the form of symbolic representation. A fast querybased
													searching strategy has been implemented using dynamic decision
													tree data structure which allows four levels of decomposition to fetch
													respective criminal records. Two types of case studies - viewed and forensic
													sketches have been considered to evaluate the strength of our proposed
													approach. We have derived 1200 views of the entire population by taking
													into consideration 80 participants as eyewitness. The system demonstrates
													an accuracy level of 98.6% for test case I and 97.8% for test case II. It has also
													been reported that experimental results reduce the search space up to 30
													most relevant records.</p>

                                                    The recent literature on face recognition technology discusses the issue of face spoofing which 
													can bypass the authentication system by placing a photo/video/mask of the enrolled person in front 
													of the camera. This problem could be minimized by detecting the liveness of the person. Therefore, 
													in this paper, we propose a robust liveness detection scheme based on challenge and response method. 
													The liveness module is added as extra layer of security before the face recognition module. 
													The liveness module utilizes face macro features, especially eye and mouth movements in order to 
													generate random challenges and observing the user's response on account of this. The reliability of 
													liveness module is tested by placing different types of spoofing attacks with various means, 
													like using photograph, videos, etc. In all, five types of attacks have been taken care of and 
													prevented by our system. Experimental results show that system is able to detect the liveness when 
													subjected to all these attacks except the eye & mouth imposter attack. This attack is able to bypass 
													the liveness test but it creates massive changes in face structure. Therefore resultant unrecognized or 
													misclassified by the face recognition module. An experimental test conducted on 65 persons on university 
													of Essex face database confirms that removal of eye and nose components results 75% misclassification.</p>

                                                    In India like many other countries, the crimes especially against women are rising. 
													One of the many reasons perhaps is the low conviction rate. The initial stage of criminal
													investigation starts with the exploration of evidences and eyewitnesses. An eyewitness can 
													act as a guide to trace out the suspect. Her/his perception about the suspect can be useful 
													to identify the criminal. Based on the descriptions of the eyewitnesses normally a manual 
													sketch is prepared and released in the Newspapers which most of the times is vague and ambiguous 
													and hence ineffective. Therefore, a robotic framework has been proposed in this paper to help 
													Police to identify criminals using the imprecise knowledge about the subject. The designed 
													robotic system interacts with the eyewitness by asking several questions about the suspect 
													such as age, height, her/his facial shape and size etc., and then making a guess about her/his face.
													A human face can be considered as the combination of various macro facial features such as eye. 
													Eyebrows, face shape, lip shape, nose type etc. Although these features vary from person to person 
													but their combination makes a human face unique. An experimental study on 113 Indian Bollywood 
													celebrities, 37 Indian cricketers and 40 persons from Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory 
													of Indian Institute of Technology Allahabad, India has been performed. The system is able to identify 
													the criminal (here pseudo criminals) if it exists in the database. This system can be useful at the 
													initial stage of investigation where we don't have any knowledge about the criminal.</p>
